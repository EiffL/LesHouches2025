This repository contains lecture materials for a one-hour introduction to Simulation-Based Inference (SBI) in cosmology, presented at the [Dark Universe Summer School](https://indico.iap.fr/event/25/) at Ã‰cole de Physique des Houches, France.

## ðŸ“š Lecture Overview

This lecture provides a comprehensive introduction to modern simulation-based inference techniques for cosmological data analysis, focusing on how we can leverage neural networks to perform Bayesian inference when traditional likelihood-based approaches are intractable.

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Objectives

By the end of this lecture, you will understand:
- The fundamental differences between SBI and traditional inference approaches
- How to estimate distributions implicitly using neural networks
- Modern techniques for neural density estimation
- Practical strategies for implementing SBI in cosmological analyses
- Key considerations for robust SBI applications
